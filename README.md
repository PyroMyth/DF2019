## DISCLAIMER
The Talend job elements were built in **Talend 6.1.1**. It appears that after that version, the Date and Date/Time string variables from the talend.properties file no longer work as expected. These jobs can be imported in to any Talend version 6.1.1 or later, and some modifications may be necessary in order for them to work in a newer version of Talend.
